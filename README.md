# Real-time Sign Language to Text using LSTM and CNN

This project aims to convert sign language to text in real-time using a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The notebook contains the code and instructions for preprocessing the data, training the model, and running real-time inference.

## Introduction

Sign language is a vital means of communication for many individuals around the world. This project leverages deep learning techniques to translate sign language into text in real-time, thereby enhancing communication for people with hearing impairments.

## Features

- **Real-time Processing**: Processes video input in real-time and translates it into text.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes LSTM for sequence learning and CNN for feature extraction.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use and modify for various sign languages.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real_time_signlanguage_to_text.git
    cd real_time_signlanguage_to_text
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher. Install the required packages using pip:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Notebook**:
    Open the Jupyter Notebook `Real_time_signlanguage_to_text_LSTM&_CNN.ipynb` and run the cells in sequence to preprocess data, train the model, and perform real-time sign language translation.

2. **Prepare the Data**:
    Follow the instructions in the notebook to prepare your dataset for training and validation.

3. **Train the Model**:
    Execute the cells related to model training. Adjust hyperparameters as needed.

4. **Real-time Inference**:
    Run the cells related to real-time inference to start translating sign language to text using your webcam or video input.
